Welcome to the repository for Positive Peter, a Discord bot meant to uplift Discord users and provide resources to professionals when needed.

## Self Hosting

Self hosting Positive Peter is possible, just rename `.env.example` to .`env.prod` and fill in all of the values. Once filled in you can run `tsc` to build the source code and then `npm run start` to run Positive Peter. You may want to run `npm run build` to quickly build the source code and run it at the same time. Support for self hosting can be found in the Discord server below!
